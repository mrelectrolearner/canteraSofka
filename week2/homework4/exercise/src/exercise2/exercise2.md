# Question
Is it possible to execute a java program containing several classes with main methods? If so, how do you determine the entry point to a program?

**Answer:**

The only entry point of a java program is a main function
with a  string array as its parameter.It's possible
to have multiples functions main that overloading
the main method, but it is only possible to have 
one entre point. So, it's allowed to have only one main with one
 string array as its parameter.
