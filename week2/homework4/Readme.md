# Homework 4

This is the homework 4 assigned in the second week of the Sofka U program *cantera 2*.
In this we developed the follow exersice:

## Exercise #1

Develop a Java class that performs the abstraction of a planetary system, 
taking into account for each body of the system aspects such as: mass, density, diameter, 
distance to the sun (assume circular orbits), a unique identifier number and a textual name. 
Include methods that calculate the gravitational attraction between any two bodies in the system.

## Exercise #2

Is it possible to run a java program containing several classes with main methods?
If so, how do you determine the entry point to a program?

## Exercise #3

Write a java program that randomly generates (Help: See the Math class 
to know how to generate random numbers in java) 
an array of real numbers, and sorts it by the bubble algorithm or 
by quick sort (this should be user chosen).

## Exercise #4

You want to implement the control of a Ferry. To do so, create a Vehicle 
class and include aspects common to all vehicles such as number of passengers, 
presence or absence of crew, number of wheels, date of registration, means of 
transport, etc. Include the methods you consider appropriate. Include the methods 
you consider appropriate.create a program capable of reading the data of 10 vehicles 
by keyboard and then list them on the screen.

## Exercise #5

From the previous class, and through inheritance create new classes 
that allow to differentiate if the object is a car, a motorcycle, a truck, 
a bicycle, a boat, etc. Include in each class some specific attribute that differentiates
it from the others. For example, for the car a Boolean that determines whether it has 
three or five doors, for the truck the height (indifferent in the other vehicles), etc. 
Make a program like the one in the previous exercise capable of working with the 
different types of vehicles.

## Exercise #6

An interesting predefined class in the java language is the Vector class, 
which implements the "dynamic array" abstraction. Review the class and use it 
(in different files) to make a program that reads numbers from the 
keyboard until the same number is entered twice in a row. 
Then the program displays all entered numbers and terminates.

## Annotations

Every exercise is solve in an individual package inside the file src using java.

The excersice 4 and 5 share the files Vehicle.java and Garage.java.
